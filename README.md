# RunicPortal

### Warning - This can/will allow you to warp to portals that you have not unlocked.  Please use at your own risk and do not blame me if you get banned.  This add-on is meant to remove the menu-lag interaction and add macro-ability to runic portal usage in a similar fashion to HomePoint addon.  Much like this warning text.

####Note: if this code is used in any fashion as a part of any other addon, please give credit.  :)

This LUA is used to warp to any runic portal within FFXI.  Simply type //rp [portal], where portal options are listed below.

Example:
//rp ai - will send you from the runic portal in Aht Urhgan Whitegate to Azouph Isle (Leujaoam Sanctum)
//rp ls - will also send you from the runic portal in Aht Urhgan Whitegate to Azouph Isle (Leujaoam Sanctum)

//rp - works from any of the staging points to send you back to Aht Urhgan Whitegate

The other available options are as follows:
Azouph Isle (Leujaoam Sanctum): ai | ls | azouph | leujaoam
Dvucca Isle (Periqia): di | p | dvucca | periqia
Mamool Ja staging point: mj | mamool
Halvung (Lebros Cavern): h | halvung | lc | lebros
Ilrusi Atoll staging point: ia | ilrusi
Nyzul Isle staging point: n | nyzul

You must be within 6 yalms of a Runic Portal to use this.

//rp reset will attempt a menu reset, but this is untested.
